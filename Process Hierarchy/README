Program accepts two command-line arguments H and C.
If the height H is greater than 1, C child processes are created using fork().
Parent waits for all of the children to complete using the wait() system call.
It waits only after creating all children.
Parent terminates after all child processes terminate.

Recursion is done using execl()

Error handling is done wherever required.

Test Cases :

1)
./akulka17_assignment1.out 2 3


		(5907): Process starting
		(5907): Parent's id = (5893)
		(5907): Height in the tree = (2)
		(5907): Creating (3) children at height (1)


	(5908): Process starting
	(5908): Parent's id = (5907)
	(5908): Height in the tree = (1)
	(5908): Creating (3) children at height (0)


	(5908): Terminating at height (1)


	(5909): Process starting
	(5909): Parent's id = (5907)
	(5909): Height in the tree = (1)
	(5909): Creating (3) children at height (0)


	(5909): Terminating at height (1)


	(5910): Process starting
	(5910): Parent's id = (5907)
	(5910): Height in the tree = (1)
	(5910): Creating (3) children at height (0)


	(5910): Terminating at height (1)


		(5907): Terminating at height (2)


2)
./akulka17_assignment1.out 1 r

Argument must be a decimal number
